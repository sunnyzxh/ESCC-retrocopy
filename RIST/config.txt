##all the items should be changed according to the file directiona and names
##the reference should be indexed by bwa and samtools
##the format of sample info should be tab-separated, including sampleID,patientID,tissue types
##you should cat all the uncategorized.tab.txt files to a single file as the gripper_output
##you should put/link all the bam files into a single folder and the name of the bam files should be the same/part of the sampleid in the gripper_output and the smaple_info
